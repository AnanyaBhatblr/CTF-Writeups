In this challenge, we need to run bin
It says SECRET_DIR is not set

Since in the question it tells that bin lists directories as root, we set SECRET_DIR to root
export SECRET_DIR="/root"
Then we see that there is a flag.txt

Now we change SECRET_DIR to lsÂ  /root | cat /root/flag.txt as cat works only if ls works
So we first list what is in root then pipe it to cat
export SECRET_DIR="ls /root | cat /root/flag.txt"
Then we get the flag

**FLAG - `picoCTF{Power_t0_man!pul4t3_3nv_1ac0e5a3}`**
