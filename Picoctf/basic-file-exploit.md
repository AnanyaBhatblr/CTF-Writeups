Here, we see this part of the code inside data_read() function which is called on entering 2 as the option

```python
 if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
   puts(flag);
   fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
   exit(0);
}
```
  

here, flag is printed on the screen when the if condition is satisfied
strtol converts the number which is inputted from str to long int value according to given base. Here it is 10.

This function returns 0 when there is no number to converted. So to get a flag, we need to enter a string instead of a number
